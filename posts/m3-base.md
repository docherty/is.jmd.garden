# Braindump: M3 "base" world

The base;
- Serves as a hub where participants can gather, fostering a sense of shared community and belonging.
- Inspires and motivates people by showcasing the work being undertaken by the community.
- Facilitates connections between like-minded individuals.
- Provides a platform for hosting events and disseminating information.
- Demonstrates the potential of collaboration and interoperability.

I believe that participants should be free to host their own Homespace on their own server or on a compliant virtual world platform.
Their self-hosted homespace has 2 parts; a virtual home in which they can have any content/experience they want (a tv studio, a jungle scene, a log cabin, an ethereal art installation etc) but they also publish a simple file on their server, me.txt (?) (think: robots.txt or humans.txt) which outlines the work they're currently doing, any interesting links etc. This file could also include data like hours worked on project x or feed from a wearable. This file is then ingested by the m3 base and presented in/on/around the user's space.

## An example
Let's asume that the base is solarpunk themed and centred around a civic meeting space (village green, town square, clearing in the woods etc). There is an event space for doing demos and displays introducing visitors to the work undertaken and areas of research. Each of the participants can have an individual space. Let's assume these are presented as cabins or treehouses in the woods. In my treehouse I have a sign that shows what I'm working on, how many hours I've worked on projects this week, all pulled in from the me.txt I published to my own homespace. Once a visitor enters my treehouse they can see my VRM models, art installations, links to my Github repos, youtube videos on the walls. There is also an AI-driven NPC that can answer questions about me and my work.

This concept reminds me of the Indieweb movement: https://indieweb.org/
