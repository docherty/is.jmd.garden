I'm currently exploring VR / AR / XR with a view to creating virtual experiences. I'm still working in Unreal Engine, Blender and Substance Painter creating 3d assets and experiences.

I am managing a portfolio of digital web3 assets which keeps me grinding with the other degen apes.

Really interested in working in VR and the productivity of working GoggledIn can bring - particularly those of us that work from home.
