This is a digital garden. My long-running passion to share tidbits that might be useful to someone was prodded by Jin & neilpo. They introduced the concept of a [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) which really chimed with my reticence to publish anything because I was in the old-school blog posting mindset.

- ðŸŒ¿ Budding for work I've cleaned up and clarified
