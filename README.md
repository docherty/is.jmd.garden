This repo is to collect markdown files that form my Digital Garden.

Using this clasification stolen from [Magie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)
- ðŸŒ± Seedling for very rough and early ideas
- ðŸŒ¿ Budding for work I've cleaned up and clarified
- ðŸŒ³ Mature

Objective is to write/dump into hackmd or Notion and then commit to this repo which triggers an action to publish the site to a host like Netlify or Vercel etc.
